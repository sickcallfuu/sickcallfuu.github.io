The Catpig

John the Cat
is most my brother, 
almost pig

even though he 
leaps among branches, 
climbs to high shelves, 
is silky.

Black and white Catpig, 
I outgrew you, 
but once we matched

She-human gave us 
our milk from 
our pitcher.

Quiet we sat
under the sumacs of Vermont 
and watched

the birds leave,
the first snow 
pepper each other's 
somber faces.
