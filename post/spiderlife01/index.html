    <section><p>From J.H. Fabre&rsquo;s <strong>Life of the Spider</strong></p>
<p>The little ones are very good:  none stirs none tries to get more</p>
<p>room for himself at his neighbours' expense.  What are they doing</p>
<p>there, so quietly?  They allow themselves to be carted about, like</p>
<p>the young of the Opossum.  Whether she sit in long meditation at</p>
<p>the bottom of her den, or come to the orifice, in mild weather, to</p>
<p>bask in the sun, the Lycosa never throws off her great-coat of</p>
<p>swarming youngsters until the fine season comes.</p>
<p>If, in the middle of winter, in January or February, I happen, out</p>
<p>in the fields, to ransack the Spider&rsquo;s dwelling, after the rain,</p>
<p>snow and frost have battered it and, as a rule, dismantled the</p>
<p>bastion at the entrance, I always find her at home, still full of</p>
<p>vigour, still carrying her family.  This vehicular upbringing lasts</p>
<p>five or six months at least, without interruption.  The celebrated</p>
<p>American carrier, the Opossum, who emancipates her offspring after</p>
<p>a few weeks' carting, cuts a poor figure beside the Lycosa.</p>
<p>What do the little ones eat, on the maternal spine?  Nothing, so</p>
<p>far as I know.  I do not see them grow larger.  I find them, at the</p>
<p>tardy period of their emancipation, just as they were when they</p>
<p>left the bag.</p>
<p>During the bad season, the mother herself is extremely abstemious.</p>
<p>At long intervals, she accepts, in my jars, a belated Locust, whom</p>
<p>I have captured, for her benefit, in the sunnier nooks.  In order</p>
<p>to keep herself in condition, as when she is dug up in the course</p>
<p>of my winter excavations, she must therefore sometimes break her</p>
<p>fast and come out in search of prey, without, of course, discarding</p>
<p>her live mantilla.</p>
<p>The expedition has its dangers.  The youngsters may be brushed off</p>
<p>by a blade of grass.  What becomes of them when they have a fall?</p>
<p>Does the mother give them a thought?  Does she come to their</p>
<p>assistance and help them to regain their place on her back?  Not at</p>
<p>all.  The affection of a Spider&rsquo;s heart, divided among some</p>
<p>hundreds, can spare but a very feeble portion to each.  The Lycosa</p>
<p>hardly troubles, whether one youngster fall from his place, or six,</p>
<p>or all of them.  She waits impassively for the victims of the</p>
<p>mishap to get out of their own difficulty, which they do, for that</p>
<p>matter, and very nimbly.</p>
<p>I sweep the whole family from the back of one of my boarders with a</p>
<p>hair-pencil.  Not a sign of emotion, not an attempt at search on</p>
<p>the part of the denuded one.  After trotting about a little on the</p>
<p>sand, the dislodged youngsters find, these here, those there, one</p>
<p>or other of the mother&rsquo;s legs, spread wide in a circle.  By means</p>
<p>of these climbing-poles, they swarm to the top and soon the dorsal</p>
<p>group resumes its original form.  Not one of the lot is missing.</p>
<p>The Lycosa&rsquo;s sons know their trade as acrobats to perfection:  the</p>
<p>mother need not trouble her head about their fall.</p>
<p>With a sweep of the pencil, I make the family of one Spider fall</p>
<p>around another laden with her own family.  The dislodged ones</p>
<p>nimbly scramble up the legs and climb on the back of their new</p>
<p>mother, who kindly allows them to behave as though they belonged to</p>
<p>her.  There is no room on the abdomen, the regulation resting-</p>
<p>place, which is already occupied by the real sons.  The invaders</p>
<p>thereupon encamp on the front part, beset the thorax and change the</p>
<p>carrier into a horrible pin-cushion that no longer bears the least</p>
<p>resemblance to a Spider form.  Meanwhile, the sufferer raises no</p>
<p>sort of protest against this access of family.  She placidly</p>
<p>accepts them all and walks them all about.</p>
<p>The youngsters, on their side, are unable to distinguish between</p>
<p>what is permitted and forbidden.  Remarkable acrobats that they</p>
<p>are, they climb on the first Spider that comes along, even when of</p>
<p>a different species, provided that she be of a fair size.  I place</p>
<p>them in the presence of a big Epeira marked with a white cross on a</p>
<p>pale-orange ground (Epeira pallida, OLIV.).  The little ones, as</p>
<p>soon as they are dislodged from the back of the Lycosa their</p>
<p>mother, clamber up the stranger without hesitation.</p>
<p>Intolerant of these familiarities, the Spider shakes the leg</p>
<p>encroached upon and flings the intruders to a distance.  The</p>
<p>assault is doggedly resumed, to such good purpose that a dozen</p>
<p>succeed in hoisting themselves to the top.  The Epeira, who is not</p>
<p>accustomed to the tickling of such a load, turns over on her back</p>
<p>and rolls on the ground in the manner of a donkey when his hide is</p>
<p>itching.  Some are lamed, some are even crushed.  This does not</p>
<p>deter the others, who repeat the escalade as soon as the Epeira is</p>
<p>on her legs again.  Then come more somersaults, more rollings on</p>
<p>the back, until the giddy swarm are all discomfited and leave the</p>
<p>Spider in peace.</p>
