    <h1 id="memories">MEMORIES</h1>
    <p>I can&#39;t remember much but I remember this:
        There were two of them from far up north and my dad and I met them at a hotel to talk. They gave us papers. We
        both read them over but I was the one who signed them. I was 16 and I made a picture, somehow – I can&#39;t
        remember.
        Later on, one of them came to our house and I was there alone but my cousin was there too, somehow. There was
        someone who went blind and then regained his sight and then went blind again.</p>
    <p>I remember this too:
        One Easter my mother gave all of us clear, green necklaces. We had tried to run away right before that. We took
        a cage meant for a hermit crab and tried to sell it to anyone who walked past us. We knew we&#39;d need some
        money if we were going to live on our own. No one bought the cage.</p>
    <p>Anyway, my mother chose clear, green necklaces as her gift. One boy was angry because his necklace was broken,
        supposedly. He complained loudly. He couldn&#39;t stop talking about how his necklace was broken.
        He even insisted on calling his own mother on the phone, just to tell her that his was broken. There were clear,
        green necklaces hanging from the tree in the front yard.</p>
    <p>The last thing I can remember is this:
        A group of children was outside and I was one of the children. Someone found a rock the size of a baseball and
        threw it at the group. I remember it coming towards us. We all laughed and smiled and it seemed like the rock
        smiled as it flew towards us. Everyone stretched out their arms, hoping that the rock would choose them. I think
        the rock chose me.</p>



    <h1 id="being-born">BEING BORN</h1>
    <p>I&#39;m the first egg laid but the last to hatch.</p>
    <p>When I was in the shell, I dreamed about all the knowledge I would come to know. And I dreamed about knowing the
        names of every color and imagined I would be surrounded and embraced by hundreds of loving arms and legs. So
        it&#39;s very disappointing to be born and find that the room is empty and that the floor is sticky and dirty.
    </p>
    <p>I try to crawl across the floor but my path goes slanted and I get stuck in a corner. I whimper sadly.
        If I whimper long enough, surely someone will hear and come to find me.</p>
    <p>When I was in the shell I had another dream, I remember:
        A Princess with clear, hard skin and an enormous, heavy shield on her back and thousands of legs. Each leg was a
        different size and color – though I don&#39;t know what colors they were now. But I&#39;m sure I must have been
        held by one of those legs and rocked gently to sleep alongside a thousand siblings.</p>
    <p>She was so beautiful, the princess...
        I understood in that moment that beauty depends on the amount of arms and legs you have. When I was in the shell
        I dreamed that I was as beautiful as that Princess but now that I&#39;m out of the shell, I begin to suspect
        that I might be ugly.</p>
    <p>Why is it taking so long for someone to come? I bark louder and louder until someone finally comes and picks me
        up.</p>

    <h1 id="nursery-and-school">NURSERY AND SCHOOL</h1>
    <p>When I get to the nursery the first thing they teach me is:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>THE FIRST THING IS LEARNING TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE.</strong><br>The first thing is learning to move
        in a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>YOU MUST ALWAYS GO STRAIGHT AHEAD AND NEVER SIDE TO SIDE.</strong><br>I must always go straight ahead
        and never side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>IF SOMETHING IS BEHIND YOU IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT EXIST.</strong><br>If something is behind me it might as
        well not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>ONE DAY YOU WILL LEAVE THIS PLACE AND YOU MUST TELL YOURSELF THAT IT DOESN&#39;T EXIST
            ANYMORE.</strong><br>One day I&#39;ll leave this place, or something...<br>It&#39;s hard to focus on the
        lesson when there are so many rags and toys lying around left behind by the others when they had to move
        forward.
    </p>
    <p>I&#39;ll grab as many as I can and bring them with me, I think to myself, opening my mouth wide.</p>

    </p>


    <p>By passing my first test, I earn one leg. A swell of pride! I could cry from happiness! I bark loudly, holding
        the leg up to the light. It bends in the middle and at the end is a foot with 2 long nails and at the bottom is
        a soft pad. What am I if I only have one leg? I study the lesson again but there is no category for me.</p>
    <p>
        <em>test 2</em><br><strong>PAY ATTENTION!</strong><br><strong>HERE&#39;S A TEST:</strong>

        type of every PERSONA AND it&#39;s related to...<br>It&#39;s related to a Type of Fish, which is a type of FISH
        the related to the Cat Persona.<br>AND has The hair all over its covered in either Bird or Worm related.
    </p>
    <p>I get it all wrong and miss an opportunity to get another leg.</p>
    <p>What does this make me? Was I a worm when I was born? And will I become a bird when I get another leg? What are
        you, since you have dozens of legs? And what was the Princess, since she had thousands of legs?</p>
    <p>
        <strong>PERSONS AND PERSONAS ARE OUTSIDE OF US.</strong><br><strong>YOU ARE A SLAUGHTERER, LIKE ALL OF
            US.</strong>

        <em>test 3</em><br>Sometimes, those who struggle with memorization do better with tasks, they
        say.<br><strong>SOMETIMES THOSE WHO STRUGGLE WITH MEMORIZATION</strong><br><strong>DO BETTER WITH A

    <p>Perhaps you’ll do better when given a task, they tell me.<br><strong>PERHAPS YOU&#39;LL DO BETTER WHEN GIVEN A

    <p>
        <strong>CUT THE FROG.</strong><br><strong>ALL PERSONS AND PERSONAS ARE FULL OF WATER.</strong><br><strong>AND
            THE WATER MUST BE FREED.</strong>
    </p>



    <h1 id="the-scraper">THE SCRAPER</h1>
    <p>Leg-Drunk, is what they call it, or Arm-Drunk.<br><strong>YOU GOT LEG DRUNK,</strong><br><strong>OR ARM DRUNK
            PERHAPS.</strong><br><strong>IT TOOK FIVE Of US TO STOP YOU</strong><br><strong>FROM RUNNING AROUND IN A
            CIRCLE.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>It&#39;s just too much, they say. You might as well walk backwards to where nothing exists, they tell me. They
        tell me I&#39;d probably cut my own siblings before actually cutting a frog or a worm.</p>
    <p>They bark amongst themselves angrily, trying to figure out what to do with me. I kept failing my tasks. I
        couldn&#39;t cut the frog or even hold it down with just my one leg. So when I found the Leg Closet overflowing
        with limbs, I thought it was right to take a few for myself. In all honesty, I thought I would be praised for my
        intelligence and my initiative. I know I&#39;m in trouble but even now I can&#39;t help but admire the ten legs
        I took from the closet.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>PAY ATTENTION!</strong><br>The decision is made: they tell me I have an appointment with the Scraper and
        that since I can&#39;t be trusted with legs or arms of any kind, I&#39;ll be made into a banner.
    </p>


    <h1 id="the-scraper-is-here">THE SCRAPER IS HERE</h1>
    <p>When the Scraper enters the room I can&#39;t help but giggle. The Scraper only has two legs! How much of a
        failure can I be if this Scraper only has two legs. It must be a real idiot, as stupid as it is ugly, that&#39;s
        for sure!
        I can&#39;t keep a straight snout as it walks towards me on its two pathetic feet. Why do they even call it the
        Scraper?</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>Well, now I know why they call it The Scraper. I howl and cry when my ten legs are taken from me and my insides
        are scooped out and thrown in the trash can. There&#39;s a long pole coming out of my stomach that keeps me high
        in the air. My howling is so pitiful they let me keep one finger, just to quiet me down. Maybe being a banner
        won&#39;t be so bad, I tell myself but when I catch my reflection in the floor, wet and reflective from the
        scraping, I realize I&#39;ll never be like the Princess.</p>
    <h1>GRADUATION</h1>
    <p>Princess,<br>I know you are alive<br>And I love you above everything I know.</p>
    <p>Hold my legs and arms close to your own<br>And make my path straight and constant.<br>Keep me from the crooked
        path,<br>The slanted path,<br>The curved path,<br>The corkscrew path,<br>The spiral path,<br>And the deadly
        circle,<br>Which forces time,<br>Age and sickness upon everything<br>That falls into its teeth.</p>
    <p>Drown the air<br>And blot out the Angels from the Sky,<br>With their perverse, circular paths.</p>
    <p>The water screams from the inside<br>And everywhere I go I will cut it free.<br>May my shell be always wet with
        the water,<br>May the water never dry on my shell
        Or my legs,<br>Or my arms.</p>
    <p>If I betray the line,<br>Let my legs forget all their knowledge.<br>If I look back,<br>Pound my shell to
        pieces.<br>I ever fall into circle,<br>End my eternal life<br>And let time slaughter me.</p>
    <h1 id="outside">OUTSIDE</h1>
    <p>At the nursery door, everyone is waving their limbs in the air. And here I am with only a finger and a pole to my
        name. But when I look down and see hundreds of beautiful arms and legs stretching towards me and the loving
        faces of so many siblings, I feel alright. I&#39;m still a slaughterer, perhaps.</p>
    <p>When the door opens, it&#39;s a shock. Nothing prepared us for how bright it would be outside. What makes it so
        bright? Are these the angels? It drives us all crazy and everyone pushes forward desperately. In the frenzy, I
        fall under the crowd and am trampled until my pole breaks and my finger snaps.</p>
    <p>When everyone is gone, I crawl over the field on my stomach. Beyond the hills, a wave of scaly water sprays high
        up into the air and I know that everyone is doing their work. They&#39;re really doing it! I try to laugh but it
        comes out as a whimper.</p>
    <p>I haven&#39;t done very well for myself, I think to myself.</p>
    <p>A grunt comes from behind a rock and it startles me. Some person is living behind that rock. Maybe there&#39;s
        one thing in this world I can still slaughter! I see the person:</p>
    <p>The -- who is it? Don&#39;t tell me:</p>
    <p>I can do it:</p>
    <p>Bigger than me, a heavy, long stomach, pale skin and a little hair.<br>Four arms with hard feet, a snout wider
        than mine, a short, spiraling tail.</p>
    <p>I know what this is! This is a Cat!</p>
    <p>You can&#39;t really slaughter with only one broken finger in your possession, I realize, so I lie and watch.
        It&#39;s funny sometimes the Cat moves behind me and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll never see it again. I&#39;m afraid
        it&#39;s dead and gone but it comes back. I think it must be circling me.</p>
    <h1 id="angels">ANGELS</h1>
    <p>The sky does the same. There are persons in the sky who do the same. Are these the Angels? Over and over, one
        appears in front of me and flies behind me and another one is always following. They&#39;re like me – they have
        no legs or arms.</p>
    <p>Gradually, the Cat multiplies into many Cats, smaller and more awkward than the first and they all circle me,
        constantly, over and over. I&#39;ve never seen anyone act like this. How is it that everyone out here is
        constantly moving all over the place?</p>
    <p>After a long time outside, I decide to try moving backwards, like an Angel. I think it will take most of my
        eternal life to figure out. I&#39;m so afraid, I close my eyes. Now, the first step is pointing your finger to
        the place you want to go. Next is the stomach and last is the head. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m facing
        backwards, where nothing exists. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m breathing air from behind me. This is the air that
        should have been gone but here it is, still here. I open my eyes and everything is gone. Everything is dark and
        there is no more ground.</p>
    <p>No, everything is here. It&#39;s just been blown to pieces. There are millions of Angels here but none are moving
        anymore.</p>
