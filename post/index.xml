      <description>I drew him more than this but discarded a few drawings because the face was all wrong&amp;hellip; these are the only two that I still think are good. With the sunlight maggot the face underneath doesn&amp;#39;t matter so much.⊕Better face, finally. (But the sunlight talisman is a little out of control.)</description>

      <description>Here are the Rogier and D drawings I&amp;rsquo;ve made from when the game came out earlier this year until now: Rogier spread - incomplete, from late summerAt some point I started to realize that in drawing this character I was trying to create a more ideal, male version of myself. (I don&amp;rsquo;t think these look like me, it&amp;rsquo;s all aspirational.)
⊕First attempt above,⊕later attempt at to the left.</description>

      <description>From Hans Henny Jahnn&amp;rsquo;s Kebad Kenya, translated by Malcolm R. Green. &amp;#8853;taken from Hans Henny Jahnn, The Living Are Few, The Dead Many, Atlas Press, 2012.In the midst of this attenuated slowness he still perceived a thing or two. He had not lost his sense of touch. On the contrary, this sense appeared to become more subtle and to spin itself around him like a web of stuff more delicate than hair.</description>

      <description>From J. H. Fabre&amp;rsquo;s Life of the Spider
The little ones are very good: none stirs none tries to get more room for himself at his neighbours&amp;rsquo; expense. What are they doing there, so quietly? They allow themselves to be carted about, like the young of the opossum. Whether she sit in long meditation at the bottom of her den, or come to the orifice, in mild weather, to bask in the sun, the lycosa never throws off her great-coat of swarming youngsters until the fine season comes.</description>

      <description>Lionel Johnson, July 1883
A DREAM
Did I ever tell you a strange kind of dream I had a few months ago ? I was sleeping quietly when I felt a shock go right through me, and I seemed to have left my body behind, and gone off to the stars ; I saw myriads of lights streaming over and on a vast white lake : I was in a state of perfect ecstasy, when I felt myself whirled back to my body, and woke up with a violent sense of splitting headache.</description>

      <description>This is just a test. Last week I got a really bad migraine that knocked me out for 2 days. I ordered groceries –which is something I really never do– and requested 2 cans of ready-to-bake biscuit dough. I hadn’t eaten in days and went through the canned biscuits fast… I ate a whole can in one day. I regret it a little bit. &amp;#8853;dummy!!! you big dummy!!!</description>
