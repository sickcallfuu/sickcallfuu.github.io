    <h2>The Catpig</h2>
    <pre>
John the Cat
is most my brother, 
almost pig

even though he 
leaps among branches, 
climbs to high shelves, 
is silky.

Black and white Catpig, 
I outgrew you, 
but once we matched

She-human gave us 
our milk from 
our pitcher.

Quiet we sat
under the sumacs of Vermont 
and watched

the birds leave,
the first snow 
pepper each other's 
somber faces.
    </pre>

    <h2>Her Lament</h2>
    <pre>
When they caressed 
and held in loving arms 
the small pig that I was, 
I was so glad, I blessed 
my singular fate.
How could I know 
my Humans would not grow 
to fit me, as I became 
Sylvia the Sow?
He-and-She-Human stayed the same, and now even look smaller.
Perhaps I should not have learned 
to adore
pleasures that could not last?
I grew so fast.
My destiny
kept me lean, and yet 
my weight increased 
Great Sylvia, I must stay
under the table at the humans' feast.
And once, scratching my back on it,
I made the table fall 
dishes and all!
How could a cherished piglet 
have grown so tall?
    </pre>

    <h2>Her Judgement</h2>
    <pre>
I love my own Humans and their friends, 
but let it be said,
that my litters may heed it well, 
their race is dangerous.

They mock the race of Swine, and call
"swinish" men they condemn.
Have they not appetites? Do we plan for slaughter to fill our troughs?
Their fat ones, despised, waddle large-footed, 
their thin ones hoard inedible discs and scraps called "money." 
Us they fatten, us they exchange for this;

and they breed us not that our life 
may be whole, pig-life
thriving alongside dog-life, bird-life, 
grass-lite, all
the lives of earth-creatures,

but that we may be devoured. Yet, 
it's not being killed for food 
destroys us. Other animals
hunt one another. But only Humans,

I think, first corrupt their prey 
as we are corrupted, stuffed with temptation until we can't move,
crowded until we turn on each other, 
our name and nature abused

It is their greed
overfattens us.
Dirt we lie in
is never unclean as their minds, 
who take our deformed lives 
without thought, without 
respect for the Spirit Pig.
    </pre>
