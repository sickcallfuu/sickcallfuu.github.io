Her Lament (from Pig Dreams)

When they caressed 
and held in loving arms 
the small pig that I was, 
I was so glad, I blessed 
my singular fate.
How could I know 
my Humans would not grow 
to fit me, as I became 
Sylvia the Sow?
He-and-She-Human stayed the same, and now even look smaller.
Perhaps I should not have learned 
to adore
pleasures that could not last?
I grew so fast.
My destiny
kept me lean, and yet 
my weight increased 
Great Sylvia, I must stay
under the table at the humans' feast.
And once, scratching my back on it,
I made the table fall 
dishes and all!
How could a cherished piglet 
have grown so tall?
