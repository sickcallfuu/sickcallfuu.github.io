title: "a dream"
---

Lionel Johnson, July 1883

Did I ever tell you
a strange kind of dream I had a few months 
ago ? I was sleeping quietly when I felt a 
shock go right through me, and I seemed to 
have left my body behind, and gone off to the 
stars ; I saw myriads of lights streaming over 
and on a vast white lake : I was in a state of 
perfect ecstasy, when I felt myself whirled back 
to my body, and woke up with a violent sense 
of splitting headache. I at once got up while 
the impression was fresh and vivid, and wrote 
down an exact record of my impressions in a 
poem : it is now somewhat unintelligible, but 
absolutely accurate as a faithful record of im- 
mense sensations and influences. I have never 
experienced anything like it before or since.


A DREAM. 

One night far up amongst the white stars dreaming 
I knew my soul wafted away from me, 

To where a clear coruscant light was gleaming 
And shot forth rays across a stilly sea. 

The air was laden with a chilling numbness 
And then my soul felt sudden iron hands 

Strike through her utterance a thrill of dumbness 
And gird her round with thwarting steely bands. 

She moved not, neither knew the fateful region 
Only the glare of white eye-dazzling rays, 

Only the blue, dark sea, and many a legion 
Of fluttering stars and spirits of unknown days. 

These only marked she and with timid wonder 
Gazed upon hosts of alternating light ; 

And ever and anon the scene asunder 
Was cleft by radiance of higher might. 

Faint with much straining of her eyes, she inward 
Turned them, and in her secret self she mused, 

Whether she now were feebly staring sinward 
And her true seeing ruthlessly abused. 

Or if to glories of the highest heaven 

These fitful blinding darts guided the way ; 

And iron bands for strengthening staves were given 
And she were gazing in the sunward day. 

While thus she mused, she felt a stirring motion 
Of tossing surges, and of restless seas ; 

And turning toward the sound, the purple ocean 
She saw besprinkled with pale phantasies. 

And to her eyes their form was as of strangers 
That know not where to turn nor how to rest, 

And hover listlessly o'er quaking dangers 

And fain would sleep upon a serpent's breast. 

Then as she downward gazed upon them lying, 
Around her flowed a sea of shimmering light 

And countless images she saw, all flying 

Down to the waves with headlong wings of flight. 

And as they touched the waters, straight a terror 
Of frantic billows rose, and clashing tides, 

And currents seethed in multitudinous error, 
And all was noise, where nought of rest abides. 

No more she knew, but when her aching senses 
Once more were quickened then in wondering wise 

She felt herself a part of piercing lenses 

Through which all things were seen by fearful eyes. 

A weird expansion felt she of her nature, 
Whereby she shared in all the world around 

And she became a part of every creature 

And was transfused in every sight and sound. 

Yet still she hung aloft in starry places 
And felt the floods of light upon her Ijfe ; 

But of the sea were gone all heaving traces, 
And only light clove light in dazzling strife. 

White stars marched on and on in high procession, 
And aeons came with steps of stately feet ; 

And in the heavenly arc was no transgression, 
And moons still rose and sank, still silver sweet. 

Only a quickening current stirred the spirit 
Of life, and self died from the range of things, 

A brother's love was each man's to inherit, 
And soul met soul with other seeking wings. 

The vision fled before my eyelids waking 
And to the glare succeeded blinding night 

As back to earth her way my soul was taking 
And the sun rose upon the face of night. 

I care not greatly for the stress of anguish 

But ah ! that I might pierce the veil that shrouds 

The unseen world, that I no more might languish 
With eyes that ache to cleave the heavy clouds. 

Thus once I cried but now I cry no longer, 
To send my soul to realms of eterne light, 

Heaven's rays than my poor soul are ever stronger, 
And heavenly stars too strong for my poor sight.
