Her Judgement (from Pig Dreams)

I love my own Humans and their friends, 
but let it be said,
that my litters may heed it well, 
their race is dangerous.

They mock the race of Swine, and call
"swinish" men they condemn.
Have they not appetites? Do we plan for slaughter to fill our troughs?

Their fat ones, despised, waddle large-footed, their thin ones hoard inedible discs and scraps called "money." Us they fatten, us they exchange for this;

and they breed us not that our life 
may be whole, pig-life
thriving alongside dog-life, bird-life, 
grass-lite, all
the lives of earth-creatures,

but that we may be devoured. Yet, 
it's not being killed for food 
destroys us. Other animals
hunt one another. But only Humans,

I think, first corrupt their prey 
as we are corrupted, stuffed with temptation until we can't move,

crowded until we turn on each other, 
our name and nature abused

It is their greed
overfattens us.
Dirt we lie in
is never unclean as their minds, 
who take our deformed lives 
without thought, without 
respect for the Spirit Pig.
